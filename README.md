# 01-horiseon-refactor

## Description

This application was created to help me practice refactoring HTML and CSS pages. It contains refactored code so it is organized and condensed better than the original code, and now follows accessibility standards. Through this project I learned the Scout Rule and left the code cleaner and more efficient than how it was originally.
